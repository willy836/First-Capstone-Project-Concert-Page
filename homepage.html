            This company logo was designed by one Kenyan through a fair competition late last year
        </p>
        <p class="logo-text-desk">
            The following company logo was decided through engaging talented Kenyan designers who 
            participated in creating very awesome logos. It was later decided by a panel of adjudicators 
            who to award a present for the best company logo this year. The winner was Wilson Kimiri. Below
